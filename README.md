# Image Classification with TensorFlow and VGG16

Theproject uses TensorFlow and VGG16 to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Setup
1. Install necessary libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install tensorflow

## Project Description
The project involves loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction, and training a neural network on top for classification.
